Our paper [MolGuidance](https://openreview.net/forum?id=WhZrYbwrKb), a follow-up work of [PropMolFlow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21469), has been accepted in ICML 2025 Generative AI for Biology (GenBio) Workshop.
In this work, we integrate three advanced property‐guidance strategies—classifier‐free guidance, autoguidance, and model guidance—into an SE(3)‐equivariant flow‐matching framework for conditional molecule generation.
