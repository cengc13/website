Our work MolGuidance, a follow-up work of [PropMolFlow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21469) has been accepted into ICML 2025 GenBio Workshop.
We integrate three advanced property‐guidance strategies—classifier‐free guidance, autoguidance, and model guidance—into an SE(3)‐equivariant flow‐matching framework for conditional molecule generation.
