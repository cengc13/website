Our work "Data-efficient and interpretable inverse materials design using a disentangled variational autoencoder" is published on line at [AI & Materials](https://www.elspub.com/journals/ai-materials/papers?currentPage=1). We employed disentangled variational autoencoder to develop a data-efficient and interpretable inverse materials design approach, which also has the potential of design materials with multiple target properties.
