Our work "Data-efficient and interpretable inverse materials design using a disentangled variational autoencoder" is published on line at [AI & Materials](https://elspub.com/papers/j/1838650894880686080.html). We employed disentangled variational autoencoder to develop a data-efficient and interpretable inverse materials design approach, which also has the potential of design materials with multiple target properties.
