I presented a <a href='https://github.com/cengc13/website/blob/master/assets/pdf/poster/CZ_MRS2023Fall_Poster_V3.pdf'>poster</a> on "Challenges and Opportunities for Machine Learning Accelerated Materials Qualification for Brittle Particle Cold Spray" at the <a href='https://www.mrs.org/meetings-events/fall-meetings-exhibits/2023-mrs-fall-meeting'> MRS 2023 Fall Meeting & Exhibit</a>. Also, Zachery Hindley, a summer intern at the Roux Engineering team I mentored, presented a talk for his internship work regarding "Image Selection for Atomistic Machine Learning using an Autoencoder".
