We introduced eigenforce model to quantify strain effect for adsorption energy and employed that to understand the oxygen reduction catalytic performance of face-centered cubic Pt--Co and Pt--Fe alloys. Thw work is now [published](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-abstract/150/4/041704/1023696/Face-centered-tetragonal-FCT-Fe-and-Co-alloys-of?redirectedFrom=fulltext) at J. Chem. Phys.
