Our PropMolFlow framework—now available [online](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21469)—uses flow matching parameterized by an SE(3)-equivariant graph neural network for conditional molecular generation. We demonstrate competitive performance against state-of-the-art diffusion models across a range of molecular properties, while maintaining high structural validity, stability, and sampling efficiency. To support reproducibility and further research, we also release two datasets: (1) DFT-computed properties for molecules generated with PropMolFlow, and (2) an updated QM9 SDF file (based on the DeepChem release) in which all bond-order and charge inconsistencies have been corrected.
