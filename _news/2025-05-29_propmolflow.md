Our PropMolFlow framework—now available [online](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21469)—uses flow matching parameterized by an SE(3)-equivariant graph neural network for conditional molecular generation. We demonstrate competitive performance against state-of-the-art diffusion models across a range of molecular properties, while maintaining high structural validity, stability, and sampling efficiency. To support reproducibility and further research, we release the full dataset at [zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/17726328).
