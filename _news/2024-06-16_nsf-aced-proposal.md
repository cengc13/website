Our full proposal "CHARMED: Collaborative Human-AI to Revolutionize Materials Exploration and Discovery" has been submitted to NSF ACED program. It proposes to innovate probabilistic models and intelligent user interface for data-efficient and interpretable inverse materials design for complex materials such as high-entropy alloys. It is an interdisciplinary proposal led by Prof. Nathan Post and in collaboration with Zulqarnain Khan (EAI research scientist) and Mahsan Nourani (Roux Human-Data Interaction vertical, Research Assistant Professor).
