Our full proposal "Physics and Mechanics of Brittle Particle Cold Spray via Machine Learning enabled Multiscale Simulaitons" has been submitted to NSF <a href='https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/advanced-manufacturing-am'>Advanced Manufacturing Program  </a> in response to a <a href='https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2024/nsf24039/nsf24039.jsp'>Dear College Letter</a>: Funding Opportunities for Engineering Research in Artificial Intelligence. It proposes to use integrated machine learning assisted simulations and experiments to overcome fundamental challenges for brittle particle cold spray, a novel additive manufacturing technique. I led the ideation and drafting of material simulations and machine learning methods for this proposal. More details of this research can be found in projects.
