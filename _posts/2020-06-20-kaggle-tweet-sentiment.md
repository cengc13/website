This blog describes the background and motivation, walks you through the dataset, evaluation metrics and submission requirements.

>With all of the tweets circulating every second it is hard to tell whether the sentiment behind a specific tweet will impact a company, or a person's, brand for being viral (positive), or devastate profit because it strikes a negative tone. Capturing sentiment in language is important in these times where decisions and reactions are created and updated in seconds. But, which words actually lead to the sentiment description? In this competition you will need to pick out the part of the tweet (word or phrase) that reflects the sentiment.

This kaggle competition aims to construct a language model that can not only identify the sentiment of a tweet but also understand why it is so.
In other words, competitors are expected to figure out what word or phrase best supports the labeled sentiment.
