Cheng Zeng is grateful to Alfond Post Doc Research Fellowship for supporting the research work at the Roux institute and the Experitial AI institute of Northeastern University. Computational simulations were conducted in part using the Discovery cluster, supported by the Research Computing team at Northeastern University.

This project focuses on an emerging additive manufacturing technique developed by a small company named TTEC LLC. This technique is termed **Brittle particle cold spray (BPCS)**. Conventional cold spray is mainly designed for ductile materials, this new technique demonstrated with brittle materials to make dense coatings on a variety of substrates at a high deposition rate and with unlimited thickness. This new technique is in essence a custom-designed low-pressure cold spray system, which uses the expansion of the gas in the diverging section of the nozzle to create a supersonic gas stream. A few experiments found that BPCS favors small-size (0.1--10 $$\mu$$m) and irregular-shapes partile feedstocks for a successful build versus large sizes (5-50 $$\mu$$m) and spherical shapes used for ductile material cold spray.
