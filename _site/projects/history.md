Moreover, as more reliable sensory techniques have been developed and implemented in the manufacturing process, more data become available, enabling a more well-rounded understanding and analysis of this process via data-driven machine learning modeling.
However, machine learning algorithms for additive manufacturing often suffers limited, noisy and high-dimensional data. Also, development of physics-informed complex models to understand intricate physical processes in BPCS may require intensive computation and substantial expertise. Opportunities emerge along with those challenges using machine learning to enhance fundamental research and application of BPCS. For instance, machine learning can be used for fast predictive modeling, which allows for process optimization and real-time control. Besides, machine learning techniques have a potential in integrating multiscale simulations seamlessly, expanding the knowledge body in this area. In addition, interpretable machine learning models can help identify the root cause of build failures, suggesting corrective actions for adaptive control. -->
