Hi! I am currently a postdoct working with Prof. [Mingjie Liu](https://www.chem.ufl.edu/about-all/directory/people/name/mingjie-liu/) at University of Florida. My research focuses on molecular-graph diffusion models and AI-driven computational study on materials for energy applications.
From 2022 to 2024, I worked at the Instutite for Experiential AI and Roux institute of Northeastern University, mentored by Prof. [Nathan Post](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/post-nathan/) and Prof. [Jack Lesko](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/lesko-john/). I am interested in solving complex engineering problems with machine learning, physical simulations and numerical methods. My research interests spans a multitude of topics including materials design, machine learning, electrochemistry,  computational catalysis, corrosion protection and additive manufacturing.
Prior to joining Roux, I received a PhD in Engineering at <a href='https://www.brown.edu/'>Brown University</a>.  En route to my PhD degree, I also received a secondary Master's degree in Data Science via Brown's <a href='https://graduateschool.brown.edu/academics-research/distinctive-opportunities/open-graduate-education'>Open Graduate Education Program</a>. At Brown, I worked at the Catalyst Design Lab under the direction of <a href='https://engineering.brown.edu/people/andrew-peterson'>Andrew Peterson</a>. My PhD research focused on machine learning potentials and force--displacement phenomenological models for rational catalyst design. A key highlight of my work is that a combination of simulation techniques---including machine learning potential, the phenomenological model, a geometric descriptor and a microkinetic analysis---generates trends of surface catalytic activity of nanoparticle electrocatalysts in various sizes and alloy compositions. Prior to Brown, I got a Bachelor and Master in Materials Science and Engineering from <a href='https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/'>Tsinghua University</a>. At Tsinghua, I worked with <a href='https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yunhan-Ling-2'>Yunhan Ling</a> on oxide films resistant to hydrogen permeation.

<!-- Currently I live in Portland of Maine with my family. Outside office, I like long-distance running, machine learning competitions on <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/'>Kaggle</a>, and playing video games. -->
