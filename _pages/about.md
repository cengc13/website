Hi! I’m currently a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Florida. Before joining UF, I was a postdoctoral fellow at the Experiential AI Institute and the Roux Institute of Northeastern University. I received my Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering and an M.S. in Data Science in 2022 from Brown University.

My research lies at the intersection of **computational materials science, computational chemistry, and artificial intelligence**. I develop **generative models, machine learning interatomic potentials, and physics-based phenomenological models** to accelerate the discovery and design of complex materials for a sustainable future.

I’m currently on the academic job market—welcome to connect!
