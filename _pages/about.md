Hi! I’m currently a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Florida. Before joining UF, I was a postdoctoral fellow at the Institute of Experiential AI and Roux Institute of Northeastern University. I received my Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering and an M.S. in Data Science in 2022 from Brown University.

My research lies at the intersection of **AI, Materials Science and Chemistry**. I develop and deploy **generative models, machine learning interatomic potentials, and phenomenological models** to accelerate materials and molecular design for a sustainable future.

I’m currently on the job market—welcome to connect via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/czeng3/)!
