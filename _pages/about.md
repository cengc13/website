Hi! I am a postdoc working with the Engineering team at the Roux institute of Northeastern University, co-advised by <a href='https://roux.northeastern.edu/people/nathan-post/'>Nathan Post</a> and <a href='https://roux.northeastern.edu/people/jack-lesko/'>Jack Lesko</a>. My research lies at the intersection of materials science, data science and additive manufacturing. I am interested in solving complex engineering problems with machine learning, numerical simulations and physical models. I believe in the Occam's razor principle when looking for efficient solutions---the simplest useful model is the best.

Prior to joining Roux, I received a PhD in Engineering at <a href='https://www.brown.edu/'>Brown University</a>.  En route to my PhD degree, I also received a secondary Master's degree in Data Science via Brown's <a href='https://graduateschool.brown.edu/academics-research/distinctive-opportunities/open-graduate-education'>Open Graduate Education Program</a>. At Brown, I worked at the Catalyst Design Lab under the direction of <a href='https://engineering.brown.edu/people/andrew-peterson'>Andrew Peterson</a>. For my PhD research, I developed a nearsighted force-training approach (NFT) to systematically generate small-size training data for learning large-size nanoparticle alloy catalysts. I also developed force--displacement physical models to describe strain effect, surface relaxation and adsorbate-adsorbate interactions which can save a large amount of DFT computational time for rational catalyst design. A combination of NFT, physical models and microkinetic analysis enables pinpointing the best size and composition of a certain class of nanoparticle alloy for electrochemical catalysis(e.g. Co--Pt nanoparticles for oxygen reduction reaction).

Currently I live in South Portland of Maine with my wife and son. I love exploring the woods, mountains and ocean outside the office. I also like long-distance running, machine learning competitions on <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/cengc13'>Kaggle</a>, and playing Nintendo Switch games.
